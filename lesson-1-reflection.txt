How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    To minimize the code area to review

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Remind me of my thinking process

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatically saved may save incomplete version to break the code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is much more helpful for program in this way to guarantee compile

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Command : git diff <commit ID1> <commit ID2>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Always has the workable version in the public region

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Maintain my own projects
